# Iphone_Gps_Arrow
An Iphone app that uses Swift's GPS package to calculate bearing in real time.

After recieving coordinate inputs of two users, it will create a real time "compass" arrow to point the two users to each other. Ignoring the limitation of current GPS precision, the app could theoretically help you find exactly where a person is.
